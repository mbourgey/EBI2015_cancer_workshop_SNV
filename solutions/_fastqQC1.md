Of the raw data we see that:
 
   - Some reads have bad 3' ends.
   - Some reads have adapter sequences in them.

We can also notice that the sequence content is 25% for each base type. Which is not what we expect for WGS data (GC content at 40%).
In our case this normal because the selected region is in a coding region which are expected to be at 50%.
