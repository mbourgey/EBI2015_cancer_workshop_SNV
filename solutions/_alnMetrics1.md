Yes, both samples showed that 99.9% of their reads have been aligned. This number is way much higher than what we would expect. This could be explain by the read selection made to generate this test dataset.


Usually, we consider: 
 
   - A good alignment if > 90%
   - Reference assembly issues if [75-90]%
   - Probably a mismatch between sample and ref if < 75 %
