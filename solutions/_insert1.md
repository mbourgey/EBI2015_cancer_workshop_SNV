Probably the different libraries used for both normal and tumor samples had different shearing methods (or technicians):
 
    - Some shearing generated long fragments (450-500 bp) but with medium precision (SD -+ 60 bp)
    - Some shearing generated medium fragments (350 bp) but with low precision (SD -+ 90 bp)
    - Some shearing generated shorter fragments (275-300 bp) but with high precision (SD -+ 25 bp)
